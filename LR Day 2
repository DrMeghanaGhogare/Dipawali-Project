 Comparing Key Technologies
Technology	Capabilities	Limitations
Whisper AI (OpenAI)	High accuracy speech-to-text with timestamping	Limited multilingual support; heavy computing requirements
Google Speech API	Fast transcription with API integration	Lacks contextual summarization features
Google Gemini Pro	Multimodal LLM handling both text and video	Newer; scalability in production unknown
YouTube Captions & ASR	Pre-generated transcripts	Lacks summarization; accuracy varies across languages
Summarize API (Groq)	Summarizes from multiple sources including YouTube	Dependent on video quality for effective summarization



Why i sthe Project Important: Though technologies like Gemini Pro and Whisper have improved both transcription and summarization, several challenges persist.
Current models struggle with accurately detecting speaker intent, managing noisy audio inputs, and adapting to multiple languages. Additionally,
the lack of real-time summarization capabilities limits their utility in scenarios requiring instant feedback.
